# 🧩 Architecting Open Source Teams  
### Building People Before Platforms  
**Sergio Canales**

> “Architecting teams before platforms means designing how people thrive before deciding how systems scale.”

---

## 1️⃣ The Common Pain  
**We start with technology… and forget the people.**

- We pick the tool first, then wonder if our team can handle it.  
- We impose skills no one wanted to develop.  
- We ignore the capabilities we already have.  
- Result: lost talent, wasted money, and frustration.  

🧠 **Key message:** A technical architecture without a human one is fragile.

---

## 2️⃣ Organization vs. Company  
**Are you in an organization or in a company?**

- An **organization** evolves organically with its people.  
- A **company** imposes processes and rewards compliance.  
- The goal: make your company *behave like* an organization.  

🌱 *Open source is not just code — it’s how people coordinate without coercion.*

---

## 3️⃣ The Human Architecture  
**Before platforms, we architect teams.**

- Organic teams define what’s possible.  
- Cross what we’re **good at** with what we **aim for**.  
- Change is fine — but give people time to align.  

⚙️ Preparation ≠ bureaucracy.  
🚫 Objectives without preparation = plans no one wants to join.

## 4️⃣ Why Open Source Teams Work  

| Open Source Principle | Organizational Need |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Voluntary contribution | Genuine engagement |
| Peer mentorship | Sustainable growth |
| Transparent review | Accountability |
| Visible merit | Recognition & motivation |
| Continuous iteration | Adaptability & resilience |

💡 **Organizations can adopt open source principles, not just its tools.**

---

## 5️⃣ The Spark ✨  
**How teams with purpose emerge.**

- Formed by shared need and recognition.  
- Purpose first, structure later.  
- Small visible wins ignite momentum.  

🔥 *Communities and internal teams often grow without budgets — just shared intent.*

---

## 6️⃣ Sustaining Momentum 🔁  
**Keeping the fire alive.**

- Integrate contribution into daily work.  
- Make recognition part of the role.  
- Allow processes and people to evolve naturally.  

🧩 “If collaboration dies, the code follows.”

---

## 7️⃣ Scaling the Team 🧱  
**Scaling without bureaucracy.**

- Lightweight structures, clear roles, shared vision.  
- Peer review and rotating responsibilities.  
- Autonomy guided by direction — *Directed Freedom.*  

🎯 Autonomy doesn’t mean chaos when vision is clear.

---

## 8️⃣ Architecture of Recognition 🏆  
**Designing systems that celebrate contributions.**

- Recognize in multiple dimensions:  
  - 💡 Technical excellence  
  - 💬 Mentorship  
  - 🌐 Community impact  
  - 📈 Continuous improvement  

📣 *The success of individuals builds the success of the organization.*

---

## 9️⃣ Directed Freedom Framework  
**A people-first model for empowered teams**

1. Clarity of purpose  
2. Defined boundaries  
3. Freedom in execution  
4. Constant feedback  
5. Public recognition  

⚖️ Freedom without direction = chaos  
📏 Direction without freedom = frustration

---

## 🔟 Patterns & Anti-Patterns  

| ✅ Healthy Patterns | ❌ Common Anti-Patterns |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Organic growth | Rigid hierarchy |
| Continuous feedback | Annual reviews |
| Guided autonomy | Micromanagement |
| Shared visibility | Recognition only for leaders |
| Learning culture | Culture of blame |

---

## 🔚 The Takeaway  
**Architecting people before platforms means:**

- Designing teams as living systems.  
- Aligning purpose, skills, and vision.  
- Letting technology reflect human synergy.  

> 🌍 *Open source is a mirror of how we wish the world worked: collaborative, transparent, human.*
